# Prison Break Game

A Puzzle game - find shortest distance from one point to another.

## Project Description

- ### Background:

  This project is a part of General Assembly's SEIF (Software Engineering Immersive Flex) Bootcamp course
  with following requirement:

  - Project Goal: Create a game using HTML, CSS and Javascript.
  - Duration: 2 weeks.

- ### Why this project?

  I was learning about Graph data structure and came across Dijkstra's algorithm(algorithm to find shortest path
  in between two points). Around the same time, we were
  tasked to develop a game as part of Bootcamp project. So I thought, why not come out with a game that is using
  this algorithm.

- ### Concept and explanation:

  Taking google map as an analogy, one of feature is finding shortest route from starting point to destination point.
  This project does the same by employing Dijkstra's algorithm.

  The codes in general is split into two parts:

  1.  Algorithm Part:

      - Generation of Graph with randomized distance in between Nodes.
      - Solution using Dijkstra's algorithm.

  2.  User Interface Part:
      - Display generated Graph.
      - Handling of user interaction.

- ### How to run the game?

- ### How to play the game?

  1.  Goal: Connect preselected Starting Node (point) to indicated Destination Node using shortest sum.

  2.  Repeated click on last selected Node would select and un-select it

  3.  Buttons:

      - [New Game] - reset to a fresh New Game.
      - [Next Level] - move to Next Unlocked Level.
      - [Previous Level] - move to Previous Level.

  4.  To win: Complete all 3 levels or score 60 points within time limit.
